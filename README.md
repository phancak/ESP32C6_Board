# ESP32-C6 Expansion Board

## Overview

This project features a modular expansion board based on the **ESP32-C6** microcontroller, designed to showcase advanced wireless connectivity and interface flexibility for proof-of-concept embedded systems. The board includes **Wi-Fi 6**, **Bluetooth 5**, and **802.15.4 (Thread/Zigbee)** support, making it suitable for modern IoT applications. In addition to its wireless capabilities, the board exposes key communication interfaces like **QSPI**, **SPI**, **I2C**, and **UART**, enabling it to serve as a powerful, plug-and-play module in larger prototype systems.

## Features

- **ESP32-C6 MCU** â€“ RISC-V single-core processor with Wi-Fi 6, BLE 5, Thread, and Zigbee support
- **QSPI Interface** â€“ For high-speed flash memory or display integration
- **SPI, I2C, UART** â€“ Standard communication protocols for versatile interfacing
- **Low Power Operation** â€“ Ideal for battery-powered and energy-conscious applications
- **Modular Design** â€“ Created for reuse across multiple proof-of-concept hardware projects

## Applications

- **IoT Prototyping** â€“ Wireless communication for smart sensors and devices
- **Home Automation** â€“ Thread/Zigbee-enabled devices with cloud connectivity
- **Industrial Monitoring** â€“ Robust wireless links in noisy environments
- **Education & Research** â€“ Hands-on embedded systems development
